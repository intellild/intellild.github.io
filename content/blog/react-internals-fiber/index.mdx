In the previous post, I introduced some basic concepts. In this post, I'm going to introduce React's implementation of Fiber.

As the previous post says, we can't pause a function's rendering phase. But, which is controlled by React, the reconciliation
among the component tree can be paused, although it is not enabled in the stable version React. Since the reconciliation
process can be paused, we need a data structure to describe things we are working on. Class components have their instances,
which can be used as the scheduled objects, but not all components have instances. Thus, we can't use class instances directly.

React creates Fiber objects for every virtual DOM elements. That means there is a fiber tree of the same shape as the element tree.

For such a component:
```jsx
function A() {
  return <div>Hello</div>
}
```
The fiber tree looks like:
```jsx
<Fiber type={A}>
  <Fiber type={'div'}>
    <Fiber type={Text} value={'Hello'} />
  </Fiber>
</Fiber>
```
During the reconciliation, React walks through the fiber and finds out differences, as the other virtual DOM implementations do.

## Reconciliation Phases
The reconciliation phases mean the phases start from an update scheduled (when a `setState` or `forceUpdate` is called)
and end with committed to DOM. There are three
phases:
* Start
* Complete
* Commit

### Start Phase
The start phase is where render functions are called. Notice that this step assumes that everything is pure. React may
suspend a start phase and resume it later, or throws away the work-in-progress update. Thus render functions should never
have side effects. Virtual DOM diff happens in this phase. This phase can be considered pure because it doesn't modify
anything out of scope. Notice that `componentWillReceiveProps`, `componentWillUpdate` and `componentWillMount` are called
during this phase and these methods usually come with side effects. That's why React deprecated them.

### Complete Phase
A completion happens when a sub-tree has finished the start phase.
In the first article, I introduced a method to perform side effects for concurrent works. During this phase, React
calculates things that need to be modified and store them on the fiber tree.

### Commit Phase
When the whole tree has finished start phase and complete phase, it's time to commit side effects. For React, side effects
includes DOM mutations, event listeners and lifecycle hooks such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `useEffect`.
The commit phase won't be paused so all side effects can be called safely.

## Twin Fibers
Since reconciliation can be paused or thrown away, one fiber is not enough because it can be messed with incomplete works.
Obviously, two fiber trees are needed:
* One for the committed work, which essentially represents what users see
* One for work-in-progress

These fibers look like twins. They are the same if no update happens. Notice that they are lazily created if you are
reading React's source code.

This post describes the basic structure of React. The next post will talk about a big boss, the concurrency problem.
