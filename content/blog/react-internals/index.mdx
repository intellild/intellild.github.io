This is the beginning of React Internals series. In this series, I'll talk about how React works.
In the first post, I'm going to talk about some concepts that are used in React but not limited to React.

## Fiber
React version 16 introduced the concept Fiber. Actually, it's an internal concept inside React, the user-land React code
has no awareness of Fiber. Unfortunately, there's no precise definition of a Fiber. Wikipedia describes Fiber as cooperative
threads, or coroutines. That's a correct but not good explanation, since people would keep asking about cooperative
threads and coroutines.
Fortunately, most front end developers are already using cooperative threads. That's async/await, with the event loop and
Promises. The core concept of Fibers is yield the execution so other work can executed, then switch back at a suitable time.

Unfortunately, Javascript hides all the low level details and there is no low level APIs for Javascript to touch the event
loop. Thus React implements its own Fiber implementation, known as React Fiber.

## Side Effect
According to wikipedia:
> In computer science, an operation, function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state
> variable value(s) outside its local environment,
> that is to say has an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation.

Side effects usually come with mutations. For example:
```js
let a = 0;
function doSomething() {
  a = 1; // this is a side effect
}
```
However, some functions can be treated with pure functions, since it doesn't modify anything outside the local scope:
```js
function doSomething(obj) {
  const result = {
    ...obj
  };
  result.id++;
  return result;
}
```

### Why side effects are important?
If an application is complex enough, we have to be aware of what a function with side effects affects all the time.
Or the whole application would be messed. That's a huge holdback for development.

For pure functions, we don't have to care about anything except the code we are working on, since we know the
function won't affect anything else. Also, it is easy to test these functions, since we don't have to mock the environment
it touches. We just care about what we give to the function and what it returns.

## No side effect in render functions and function components
Why? Remember that fibers can yield the execution. That means the work can be paused.
I'm using generators for example:
```js
const state = {
  type: 'dog',
  food: 'dog food'
};
function* task(type) {
  state.type = type;
  yield;
  switch (type) {
    case 'cat':
      state.food = 'cat food';
      break;
    case 'dog':
      state.food = 'dog food';
      break;
  }
}

execute(task('cat'));
```
If the task is paused at the yield and someone else read the value, that guy would get an in-complete transition of the state.
In this case, we serve our poor cat with dog's food.

How to prevent the illed state problem? One easy way is to delay the mutation.
```js
const state = {
  type: 'dog',
  food: 'dog food'
};
function* task(type) {
  state.type = type;
  yield;
  switch (type) {
    case 'cat':
      return 'cat food';
    case 'dog':
      return 'dog food';
  }
}
```
Now the `task` is a pure function. The only thing we need to do now is getting the returned value of `task` and modify
the state in our executor and make sure the modification process can't be paused.

## Side Effect and React
In React, the update process is called 'reconcile'. A single render method of class component or a function component
can't be paused since we never write it as a generator, but the update process of the component tree can be paused or
event thrown away.

Mutations to the DOM in React is treated as side effects. No DOM element would be modified until the whole update process
is completed.

Assume A and B are function components here:
```jsx
let a;

<A>
  <B />
</A>
```
That means, when the reconciler finishes calling A with its returned virtual dom, the work can be paused.
If we modified the global variable a in A's function body and reset it in B's function body, but unfortunately the update
process is thrown away for some reason, for example, their parent component unmounts the sub tree before the update process
finishes. Then the variable a is in illed state.

That's why you should never write side effects in render functions.

### What about hooks? These don't seem to be pure?
Trust me, React hooks can be implemented as pure functions. If we implemented them as pure functions, that would be
a disaster for Javascript.

In this post, I introduced some common concept. In the next post, I'm going to talk React's internal implementation of Fibers.
