In the previous post, I introduced the basic structure of React Fiber. Since React introduced concurrent rendering,
the reconciliation must be implemented very carefully.

Assuming we have such a tree:
```jsx
<A>
  <B>
    <C />
  </B>
</A>
```
When the user calls `setState` on component B, can we simply push the Fiber of component B onto the task queue?
When I first looked at the implementation of React, I thought it would be fine. However, I was wrong.
Think of the following scenarios:
* An update is scheduled on the parent or child tree if we have a work-in-progress work.
* An update is scheduled on the parent or child tree after we scheduled an update
* The sub-tree is going to be unmounted by its parent while it is being reconciled

When a task is scheduled for component B, we don't know if A or C also scheduled an update. If we simply start the virtual
DOM diff work from component B, B could be updated with old props while A would be passing it with new props. It is similar
for other scenarios. This is a concurrency safety problem and would lead to weird behaviors and bugs.

Shall we check the parent tree and the child tree every time we call the `setState`? This would be a performance disaster
with duplicated works. React's solution is checking the whole tree when the reconciliation starts. This seems to be slow
but actually not at all, since we don't need to re-render the components that are not having updates and we can simply
copy the result of the previous render.

The whole picture becomes the following:
1. Mark the sub-tree has an update
2. Schedule a work for root, since we are checking the whole tree
3. The reconciler starts to walk down the tree. If the current visited component doesn't have any updates, simply copy
the previous result. Having no update means there is no pending `setState` and no new props. Notice that we are not copying
things related to its children, since we don't know if there is anything to do with its children.
4. Check child tree of the component. Then we have two path:
* If all the children don't have an update, we have finished the reconciliation of the current component. This is called
bailout in React.
* If a child has updates, follow step 3.
5. Once a sub-tree is all checked, `completeWork` is called for the root node of the sub-tree

These processes will be repeated until the whole tree is finished. After the whole tree is finished, React starts the
commit phase introduced in the previous post, including modifying DOM.

This post I introduce the concurrency problem of concurrent rendering and the working process of React reconciler.
However, it is not enough, since React introduced priorities. In the next post, I am going to talk about how React solves
concurrent rendering with different priorities.
